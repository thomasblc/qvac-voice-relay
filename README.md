# QVAC Voice Relay

Enroll your voice, then type or speak a phrase and hear it played back in your own voice, translated into another language. 100% on-device with the [QVAC SDK](https://docs.qvac.tether.io/): no cloud, no account, your voice never leaves the machine.

> Wording note: the spoken output is QVAC TTS voice conditioning from a recorded reference sample (set at model load time). We say "enrolled voice" / "reference-matched voice", not "clone".

## Features

- Enroll one or more named voices (persisted locally, manage and erase them)
- Input by typing or by microphone (Parakeet STT; source language is selected explicitly)
- On-device translation (Bergamot NMT, pivots through English)
- Debounced translate-then-play flow: text is translated first, then the play button synthesizes the ready translation
- Reference-matched speech output in 17 languages (EN, ES, FR, DE, IT, PT, NL, PL, TR, SV, DA, FI, NO, EL, MS, AR, KO)
- Consent-first enrollment and a one-click erase per voice
- Two-step UI (Enroll / Use), animated orb

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- `ffmpeg` on PATH (audio normalization)
- `@qvac/sdk` 0.12.x (installed by `npm install`)
- 16 GB RAM minimum, 32 GB + a GPU / Apple Silicon recommended (the GGML Chatterbox model is multi-GB; an 8 GB machine is not enough)

## Run

```bash
npm install        # installs @qvac/sdk
node server.js     # then open http://localhost:3071
```

`PORT` is configurable via the environment (defaults to 3071).

## Where things live

- Enrolled voices: `~/.qvac-voice-relay/voices/<id>.16k.wav` + `voices.json` (outside the app folder, so the app stays packageable)
- Models: downloaded and cached by the SDK in `~/.qvac/models/` on first use (shared across all QVAC apps)

## Limitations

- Output voice languages: 17 (every language the TTS package supports that also has a Bergamot translation path). Swahili is left out because there is no EN->SW translation model.
- Microphone transcription uses the shared Parakeet GGUF model; the selected source language drives the translation path.
- First run downloads the models (a few GB)

## Packaging (later)

The app is a Node HTTP server + a static frontend, so it can be wrapped into a desktop `.app`/`.dmg` later (for example with Electron or a Tauri sidecar). Nothing here hardcodes absolute paths: the server resolves its own folder via `import.meta.dirname` and stores user data under the home directory, both of which survive packaging.
